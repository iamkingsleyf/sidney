PRIMARY NAVIGATION EXTRAS
	As of Genesis 2.1, the Primary Navigation Extras options have been removed for new installs. (upgrades of current installs to 2.1 will not lose the Primary Navigation Extras settings)

	- instagram
	- linkedin
	- pinterest
	- reddit
	- rss
	- stumbleupon
	- tumblr
	- twitter
	- vimeo
	- wordpress
	- youtube

	For example, to add a Twitter link, add a custom link to your menu and in the CSS Classes input field enter right twitter. Refer to the theme docs for details.


CONTENT BOXES
	The custom content boxes make use of DIV classes. For example ...

	<div class="content-box-blue">some random text</div>

	There are 8 styles to choose from. Refer to the style sheet for details.

GRADIENT BUTTONS
	Each button has a unique class. For example ...
